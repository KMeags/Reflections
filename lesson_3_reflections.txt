When would you want to use a remote repository instead of kepeing all your work local?

I would like to use this when I am working from different computers or with other people on a project

GitHub!!!
git push remote (branch)
git pull remote (branch)
git remote
> origin

SSH Keys??? Sorta got it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date
with remote?

If working with multiple people, allows us to work independently without overwriting each others work. 
Extra backup

Fork, Clone, Branch difference
Forking is copying from Github to Github
Cloning is copying from next/other machine to my computer/Git
Branching is creating a copy of my master branch within my repository

Git push origin master

Describe the difference between fork- nevermind^ lol

git pull origin 
master = git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master
origin/master = local copy of GitHub master
master = local master

origin/master doesn't update without being fetched. when fethced, it syncs to the GitHub on new branch from my 
master. I have to merge the two to make it effectively a "pull"

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Perhaps if I am getting on a plane or will be away from work for a while, I can see the last known copy compared with 
my own work, or the work that has been done since I left, so I know what has changed.
