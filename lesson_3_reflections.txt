When would you want to use a remote repository instead of kepeing all your work local?

I would like to use this when I am working from different computers or with other people on a project

GitHub!!!
git push remote (branch)
git pull remote (branch)
git remote
> origin

SSH Keys??? Sorta got it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date
with remote?

If working with multiple people, allows us to work independently without overwriting each others work.
